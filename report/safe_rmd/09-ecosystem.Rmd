# Ecosystem Considerations

## Ecosystem Effects on the Stock


### Prey Availability/Abundance trends
Based on results from an ecosystem model for the Gulf of Alaska [@Aydin2007], flathead sole in the Gulf of Alaska occupy an intermediate trophic level as both juvenile and adults (Figure 36, Figure 37). Pandalid shrimp and brittle stars were the most important prey for adult flathead sole in the Gulf of Alaska (64% by weight in sampled stomachs; [@Yang2000]; Figure 36, Figure 38), while euphausids and mysids constituted the most important prey items for juvenile flathead sole (Figure 37, Figure 39). Other major prey items included polychaetes, mollusks, bivalves and hermit crabs for both juveniles and adults.  Commercially important species that were consumed included age-0 Tanner crab (3%) and age-0 walleye pollock (< 0.5% by weight).  Little to no information is available to assess trends in abundance for the major benthic prey species of flathead sole.

### Predator population trends

Important predators on flathead sole include arrowtooth flounder, walleye pollock, Pacific cod, and other groundfish (Figure 40, Figure 41). Pacific cod and Pacific halibut are the major predators on adults, while arrowtooth flounder, sculpins, walleye pollock and Pacific cod are the major predators on juveniles.  The flatfish-directed fishery constitutes the third-largest known source of mortality on flathead sole adults.  However, the largest component of mortality on adults is unexplained.

## Fishery Effects on the Ecosystem 

Non-target catch in the directed GOA flathead sole fishery are shown in Table 18. Prohibited species catch in the directed GOA flathead sole fishery are shown in Table 19. Historically, the flathead sole fishery has caught a high proportion of the brittlestar, eelpouts, gunnels, polychaetes, and Stichaeidae in some years. In 2014 and 2015, proportion of non-target species caught in the flathead sole fishery ranged from 0 to 32% (32% of Pandalid shrimp were caught in the flathead sole fishery in 2015). Prohibited species catch in the flathead sole fishery were 0-2% of the prohibited species catch of each of these species in 2014 and 2015.
