# Data Gaps and Research Priorities
The 2015 and 2017 stock assessments incorporated ageing error by using an existing ageing error matrix for BSAI flathead sole. A priority for future assessments is to analyze ageing error data for GOA flathead sole using methods described in Punt et al. (2008) and to incorporate a resulting ageing error matrix into the assessment. Future analyses should explore the relationship between natural mortality and catchability in the model, alternative parameter values, and the effects of these parameters on estimation of selectivity and other parameters. The assessment would benefit from an exploration of ways to better account for scientific uncertainty, especially uncertainty associated with parameters that are currently fixed in the model. Examination of genetic stock structure of flathead sole throughout its range and within the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea is important for understanding whether spatial management units are properly allocated.
