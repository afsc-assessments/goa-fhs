# Data

The following table summarizes the data used in the stock assessment model for northern rockfish (bold denotes new data for this assessment):

## Fishery

(ref:ssfilesource) used in the assessment can be seen in the Stock Synthesis data file hosted here: https://github.com/mkapur-noaa/goa-fhs-2022/ModelFiles_Preliminary.


### Catch

The assessment included catch data from `r min(base_model$catch$Yr)` to `r date` (Figure \@ref(fig:removals)). Catches of flathead sole occur almost entirely in the Western and Central management areas in the GOA (statistical areas 610 and 620 + 630, respectively, (Table \@ref(tab:catchbyarea)). Historically, catches have been well below the management specifications, on the order of 10% of Total Allowable Catch over the last 10 years \@ref(fig:catchvsTAC). 

### Age and Size Composition

Fishery length composition data were included in 2cm bins from 6-56cm in `r with(subset(base_model$lendbase, Fleet == 1),paste0(unique(Yr), collapse = ", "))`; data were omitted in years where there were less than 15 hauls that included measured flathead sole (1982-1988, 2000, 2008). The effective sample size for fishery length composition data were the number of hauls [@Pennington1994]. Fishery length composition (ref:ssfilesource)

## Survey

### Biomass Estimates from Trawl Surveys

Survey biomass estimates originate from a cooperative bottom trawl survey conducted by the U.S. and Japan in 1984 and 1987 and a U.S. bottom trawl survey conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) Division thereafter. Calculations for final survey biomass and variance estimates are fully described in Wakabayashi et al. (1985). Depths 0-500 meters were fully covered in each survey and occurrence of `r species` at depths greater than 500 meters is rare (Table \@ref(tab:tab4survbioareadepth)). The survey excluded the eastern region of the Gulf of Alaska (the Yakutat and Southeastern areas) in 2001. 

<!-- As for previous assessments, the availability of the survey biomass in 2001 was assumed to be 0.9 to account for the biomass in the eastern region of the Gulf.  -->

The total survey biomass estimates and CVs that were used in the assessment are listed in Table \@ref(tab:tab5inputsurv).  Survey biomass decreased slightly from `r prettyNum(base_model$cpue$Obs[base_model$cpue$Yr==2019], big.mark = ',')` t in 2019 to `r prettyNum(base_model$cpue$Obs[base_model$cpue$Yr==2021], big.mark = ',')` t in 2021.
Figure \@ref(fig:survmap) shows maps of survey CPUE in the GOA for the most recent two survey years; survey CPUE in both years was highest in the Central and Western GOA.


### Age and Size Composition 
This assessment includes sex-specific length compositions from the trawl survey, as well as age frequencies of fish by length (conditional age-at-length, CAAL). For both compositional data types, the effective sample size was the number of hauls [@Pennington1994]; see section on data weighting for further discussion.
Marginal survey age composition data is also included in the data input file, but is "ghosted" and therefore does not contribute to the joint negative log likelihood. 

We use conditional age-at-length data for the following reasons: 1) The approach preserves information on the relationship between length and age and provides information on variability in length-at-age such that growth parameters and variability in growth can be estimated within the model. 2) The approach resolves the issue of double-counting individual fish when using both length- and age-composition data (as length-composition data are used to calculate the marginal age compositions). See Stewart (2005) for further discussion of the use of conditional age-at-length data in fishery stock assessments.

### Maturity Data
The maturity ogive for flathead sole followed an age-based logistic curve where age at 50% maturity was 9.7 and age at 95% maturity was 12.8.
