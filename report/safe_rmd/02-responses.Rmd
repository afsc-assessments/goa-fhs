## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments on Assessments in General

> "The SSC requests that all authors fill out the risk table in 2019…" (SSC December 2018)  

A risk table has been included in this assessment.

> "Any new model that diverges substantially from the currently accepted model will be marked with the two-digit year …" (SSC December 2016)  

The model presented this year follows this convention and is labeled as `r base_model_name`, to reflect that the structure has not changed from the previously accepted full model from 2017. The latter is referred to as `r old_model_name`.

## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments Specific to this Assessment

> "The SSC concurs with the PT and author that a priority for future assessments is to analyze ageing error data for GOA flathead sole using methods described in Punt et al. (2008) and to incorporate a resulting ageing error matrix into the assessment. In addition, the SSC supports the PT and author’s recommendations that future analyses should explore the relationship between natural mortality and catchability in the model, alternative parameter values, and the effects of these parameters on estimation of selectivity and other parameters. Finally, the SSC encourages the author to explore ways to better account for scientific uncertainty, especially uncertainty associated with parameters that are currently fixed in the model. (SSC Dec 2017)"

The ageing error matrix has been updated using the latest age-read data specific for GOA `r species`. A detailed overview of how the matrix values were chosen is available at https://mkapur-noaa.github.io/goa-fhs-2022/AgeingError_Writeup_Static.html. A comparison of the biomass time series for the new base model using both this updated ageing error matrix (`r base_model_name`) and using the matrix from the previously accepted assessment is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ageErrCompare). 

(ref:ssfilesource) This assessment re-conducted the likelihood profiling exercises on catchability (q), natural mortality (M), and combinations thereof done in the previous full assessment [@Turnock2017]. The data weights remained unchanged during profiling. For this cycle, we extended the upper limit of q values included in the profile to 10 (in log space), and also conducted a profile on unfished recruitment $R_0$, Figures \@ref(fig:profileM) - \@ref(fig:profileR0). When each parameter is profiled independently (Figures \@ref(fig:profileM) and \@ref(fig:profileLNq)), the minimum total negative log-likelihood for `r base_model_name` occured at q = 1.6 and M = 0.26 (in the previous assessment, these values were 1.4 and 0.28, respectively; though values over 1.4 for q were not explored). The profile on q is shallow for all data besides the age data below 1.6, and both the index and length composition data profiles on q were minimized closer to 1.  It appears that given the current model structure, there is conflict between the age and length data regarding the value of M, which was also observed during the last assessment [@Turnock2017], whereby the age data suggests the highest value for M (0.28) and the length composition data suggests M to be 0.14.   *When profiled concurrently...Survey likelihood was minimum at Q=1.3 and M=0.16.  Age data fit best at Q=1.1 and M=0.28, While length data was best fit at Q=1.5 and M=0.28.  The M where the total likelihood surface is lowest increases with increasing survey Q (Figure 28).  Survey likelihood is relatively flat over the range of survey Q with M between about 0.25 and 0.2 (Figure 29).  The survey likelihood surface and a small dip at Q=1.3 and M=0.16 where the lowest likelihood occurs.  Length data are fit best a higher M and higher Q, however length likelihood also declines as M declines towards 0.1 (Figure 30).  Age likelihood is the highest component of the total likelihood and is relatively flat from Q>1.0 and M between about 0.25 and 0.3 (Figure 31).   However, the fishery age at 50% selected for males and females shifts up to above 16 when M is below 0.18 (Figures 32 and 33).  This indicates instability in the fishery selectivity parameters which needs to be investigated for the interpretation of the likelihood profiles to be meaningful.  However, the length data are fit better as M goes below 0.18 (Figure 30).  Age at 50% selected for the survey increases from about 3.4 to 6.0 as M increases from 0.1 to 0.3 for both males and females (Figures 34 and 35).  Survey Q seems to have little effect on the age at 50% selected.* A profile on $R_0$ (Figure \@ref(fig:profileR0)) indicated that unfished recruitment is well-estimated in the present model configuration, with no disagreement among datasets about the model scale. For future iterations, assessors should consider the interaction between data weights (which up-weight all lengths and down-weight all CAAL data), the corresponding fits to the survey (which are poor in the last two years) and length compositions (which improve when M is below 0.18), and the ...

## Responses to CIE (2019) Comments agreed upon by all three reviewers

The comments below are from Appendix 4 of the CIE review conducted in July 2019 by panelists Cordue, Tingley, and Trzcinski. Note that this review included rex and Dover soles in addition to flathead, and the Appendix indicates that some comments might be applicable to flathead only in a general sense.

> "The Gulf of Alaska Bottom Trawl Surveys (BTS) conducted in 1984 and 1987 used different vessels, a different approach and with different timing. These surveys should not be considered as part of the same timeseries as the subsequent BTS timeseries. Specifically, the biomass estimates and the composition data from
these two surveys should be dropped from each of these assessments, and probably from all
other assessments also."

>"The surveys in 1990 and 1993 had a different timing (later) and somewhat different survey
structure. While clearly not as ‘different’ as the 1984 and 1987 surveys, there is sufficient
difference that model sensitivities should be run on a species-by-species (stock-by-stock) basis
that include and exclude the biomass and composition data from these two surveys."

We did not have time to conduct multiple sensitivity analyses for this topic (removing 1980s survey data, and separating early 1990s survey data). Instead, we conducted a sensitivity analysis where the survey biomass, length composition, and conditional age-at-length data were truncated before 1993 due to the differences in survey design. Given the structure of the current model, we did not see sufficient differences in terminal year biomass, recruitment deviations, or survey fits between these two models (Figure XX). It is likely this was more of an issue for other species considered in the CIE report. For thoroughness, if future cycles include the calculation or estimation of catchability q different from 1.0, it would be worth considering introducing a time-block on catchability for survey data before 1993 or thereafter.

>"Where there are gaps in survey data due to, for example, not surveying some areas in some years,
these should be left as data gaps. The model structures used are more than capable of dealing
with such data gaps. Data should not be created by extrapolation, interpolation or modelling to
fill such gaps."

To the author's knowledge this comment is not applicable to GOA `r species`.

> "A more consistent, analytical and defensible approach to the scaling and stratification of fisheries data should be followed. This should meet accepted ‘best practice’ approaches, including, for example, studying the spatial and temporal patterns of length and age followed by appropriate
stratification and scaling."

The authors agree. Revisiting the methods by which, for example, composition data are expanded from survey hauls is an active area of research. We did not revisit it for this assessment cycle.

>"Models should not assume that the survey q is equal to 1. Informed priors should be developed
on a stock-by-stock basis."

 `r base_model_name` has q fixed at 1, as in the previous assessment (`r old_model_name`). We explored a sensitivity run where q was either estimated with bounds from -15 to 15, or calculated analytically from the biomass available to the survey. In both cases, q was either estimated or calculated to be ~1.6, consistent with the location of the MLE shown in the likelihood profile (Figure \@ref(fig:profileLNq)). However, these changes resulted in worser fits to the survey and drastically different biomass timeseries, so further research is needed before incorporating either approach (with the potential inclusion of a prior) as suggested by the CIE. The author recommends discussions with the Survey group about the encounter rate of `r species`, and the potential for design-based indices to alleviate some of these issues.


> "Recruitment deviates should not be estimated where there is no information to inform the
estimation, i.e. there has to be age data from a survey or fishery to inform the estimation process."

We conducted a sensitivity for `r base_model_name` where in the "early" period for recruitment deviations begins at the onset of survey biomass & length composition data in 1983 (though see note above about differences in survey design).
