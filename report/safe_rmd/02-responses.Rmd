A risk table has been included in this assessment.

## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments Specific to this Assessment

> "The SSC concurs with the PT and author that a priority for future assessments is to analyze ageing error data for GOA flathead sole using methods described in Punt et al. (2008) and to incorporate a resulting ageing error matrix into the assessment. In addition, the SSC supports the PT and author’s recommendations that future analyses should explore the relationship between natural mortality and catchability in the model, alternative parameter values, and the effects of these parameters on estimation of selectivity and other parameters. Finally, the SSC encourages the author to explore ways to better account for scientific uncertainty, especially uncertainty associated with parameters that are currently fixed in the model."

The ageing error matrix has been updated using the latest age-read data specific for `r species`. A detailed overview of how the matrix values were chosen is available at XX. A comparison of the new base model using both this updated ageing error matrix and the matrix from the previously accepted assessment is shown in Figure XX.

This assessment re-conducted the likelihood profiling exercises on catchability (q), natural mortality (M), and combinations thereof done in the previous full assessment [@Turnock2017]. For this cycle, we extended the upper limit of q values included in the profile to 5 (in log space), and also conducted a profile on unfished recruitment $R_0$ Figure XX. It appears that given the current model structure, there is conflict between the age and length data regarding the value of M XX explain consistent findings with previous 

Because this was the present author's first year conducting this assessment, no structural changes are proposed. For 

## Responses to CIE (2019) Comments agreed upon by all three reviewers

The comments below are from Appendix 4 of the CIE review conducted in July 2019 by panelists Cordue, Tingley, and Trzcinski. Note that this review included rex and Dover soles in addition to flathead, and the Appendix indicates that some comments might be applicable to flathead only in a general sense.

> "The Gulf of Alaska Bottom Trawl Surveys (BTS) conducted in 1984 and 1987 used different vessels, a different approach and with different timing. These surveys should not be considered as part of the same timeseries as the subsequent BTS timeseries. Specifically, the biomass estimates and the composition data from
these two surveys should be dropped from each of these assessments, and probably from all
other assessments also."

>"The surveys in 1990 and 1993 had a different timing (later) and somewhat different survey
structure. While clearly not as ‘different’ as the 1984 and 1987 surveys, there is sufficient
difference that model sensitivities should be run on a species-by-species (stock-by-stock) basis
that include and exclude the biomass and composition data from these two surveys."

We did not have time to conduct multiple sensitivity analyses for this topic (removing 1980s survey data, and separating early 1990s survey data). Instead, we conducted a sensitivity analysis where the survey biomass, length composition, and conditional age-at-length data were truncated before 1993 due to the differences in survey design. Given the structure of the current model, we did not see sufficient differences in terminal year biomass, recruitment deviations, or survey fits between these two models (Figure XX). It is likely this was more of an issue for other species considered in the CIE report. For thoroughness, if future cycles include the calculation or estimation of catchability q different from 1.0, it would be worth considering introducing a time-block on catchability for survey data before 1993 or thereafter.

>"Where there are gaps in survey data due to, for example, not surveying some areas in some years,
these should be left as data gaps. The model structures used are more than capable of dealing
with such data gaps. Data should not be created by extrapolation, interpolation or modelling to
fill such gaps."

To the author's knowledge this comment is not applicable to GOA `r species`.

> "A more consistent, analytical and defensible approach to the scaling and stratification of fisheries data should be followed. This should meet accepted ‘best practice’ approaches, including, for example, studying the spatial and temporal patterns of length and age followed by appropriate
stratification and scaling."

The authors agree. Revisiting the methods by which, for example, composition data are expanded from survey hauls is an active area of research. We did not revisit it for this assessment cycle.

>"Models should not assume that the survey q is equal to 1. Informed priors should be developed
on a stock-by-stock basis."

We explored a sensitivity run where q was either estimated with bounds from -15 to 15, or calculated analytically from the biomass available to the survey. In both cases, q was estimated to be ~1.6, consistent with the location of the MLE shown in the likelihood profile (FIGURE XX). However, these changes resulted in worser fits to the survey and drastically different biomass timeseries, so future research is needed before incorporating either approach (with the potential inclusion of a prior) as suggested by the CIE. The model presented here (17.1a) has q fixed at 1 as in the previous assessment.


> "Recruitment deviates should not be estimated where there is no information to inform the
estimation, i.e. there has to be age data from a survey or fishery to inform the estimation process."

We conducted a sensitivity on the model presented here (17.1a) where in the "early" period for recruitment deviations begins at the onset of survey biomass & length composition data in 1983 (though see note above about differences in survey design).
