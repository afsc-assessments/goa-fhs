## Area Allocation of Harvest

Area apportionment for ABC of `r species` is currently based on the proportion of survey biomass projected for each area in `r year+1` and `r year+2` using the new survey averaging random effects model "REMA" developed by the survey averaging working group (see https://github.com/afsc-assessments/rema for more information).  A bridging exercise confirmed that this package, written in Template Model Builder, produces the same results as the ADMB-RE package used for this stock in previous years when fitting the three geographic strata simultaneously. Please refer to the 2017 full stock assessment report [@Turnock2017] for information regarding the apportionment rationale for GOA `r species`.
 
The following table shows the recommended ABC apportionment for `r year` and `r year +1`. 


```{r}
# apportionment table example
# appo <- safe::apportion
appo <- read.csv(here::here('re',paste0(Sys.Date(),"-AreaAppportionment.csv")))
appo$Year <- as.character(appo$Year)
# appo[2:3,4:8] <- data.frame(as.numeric(appo[2:3,4:8] ))
flextable::flextable(appo[,-1]) %>%
     flextable::hline_top(part='all') %>% 
    flextable::hline_bottom() %>%
  flextable::colformat_num(big.mark = ',')
 
```
